# 2026CT-BioMech-Samuel.H-Tommy.D

This project that I am making, is a heart-rate sensor for my patient Vivian, who needs a bio-medical device to help her to keep her heartrate in check. Her doctor has told her that exceeding a heart-rate of 150bpm would not be safe. This leads to my intention as an engineer, to desgin a device that will help Vivian make sure her heart-rate stays below 150bpm and alerts her when she exceeds it.

For this project, the Equipment I wil need will include:

- Arduino Kit
- Connecting Wire
- Heart-rate Sensor
- Buzzer
- LED
