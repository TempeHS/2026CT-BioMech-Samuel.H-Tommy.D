This prodject that I am making, is a heart-rate sensor for my patient vivan, who needs a bio-medical device to help her to keep her heartrate in check. Her doctor has told her that exceeding a heartrate of 150bpm would not be safe. THis leads to my intention as an engineer, to designa device that will help vivan make sure her heartrate stays below 150bpm and alerts her when she exceeds it.

For this prodject, the equipment i will need will include

-Arduino kit
-Connecting wire
-
